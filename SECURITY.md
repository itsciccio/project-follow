# 🔒 Security & Privacy Checklist

## 🚨 Critical Security Measures

### ✅ **Before Using the Tool**
- [ ] **Never share your Instagram credentials** with anyone
- [ ] **Don't commit** `curl_input.txt` or `instagram_curl.txt` to Git
- [ ] **Don't commit** the `instagram_data/` directory to Git
- [ ] **Use the `.gitignore` file** to automatically protect sensitive data

### ✅ **When Getting Instagram Credentials**
- [ ] **Use a private browser session** or incognito mode
- [ ] **Get fresh credentials** each time (sessions expire)
- [ ] **Don't save credentials** in browser bookmarks or notes
- [ ] **Clear browser data** after getting credentials if needed

### ✅ **Data Handling**
- [ ] **Keep collected data private** - it contains real usernames
- [ ] **Don't share analysis results** publicly
- [ ] **Respect Instagram's terms of service**
- [ ] **Use data responsibly** for personal analysis only

## 🛡️ How the Tool Protects You

### **Automatic Protection**
- **`.gitignore`** prevents sensitive files from being committed
- **Real-time validation** ensures credentials are properly formatted
- **Error handling** prevents partial data exposure
- **Clean output** removes sensitive information from logs

### **File Security**
- **`curl_input.txt`** - Contains your raw Instagram credentials
- **`instagram_curl.txt`** - Contains formatted credentials
- **`instagram_data/`** - Contains all collected user data
- **All automatically ignored** by Git

## 🔍 Security Features Built-In

### **Credential Protection**
- Instagram API credentials are never logged
- Session cookies are kept private
- CSRF tokens are not exposed in output
- User IDs are anonymized in logs

### **Data Privacy**
- Collected usernames are kept local only
- No data is sent to external services
- Analysis results are stored locally
- Network requests only go to Instagram's official API

## ⚠️ What to Watch Out For

### **Never Do This:**
- ❌ Commit credentials to version control
- ❌ Share your `curl_input.txt` file
- ❌ Post analysis results publicly
- ❌ Use the tool for commercial purposes
- ❌ Violate Instagram's rate limits

### **Always Do This:**
- ✅ Keep credentials private and secure
- ✅ Use the `.gitignore` file
- ✅ Respect Instagram's terms of service
- ✅ Handle collected data responsibly
- ✅ Update credentials when sessions expire

## 🚀 Safe Usage Workflow

1. **Get fresh Instagram credentials** (private browser session)
2. **Put credentials in `curl_input.txt`** (never commit this file)
3. **Run the tool** to collect and analyze data
4. **Review results locally** (keep private)
5. **Delete or secure** any temporary credential files
6. **Update credentials** when they expire (usually 24-48 hours)

## 🔐 Advanced Security (Optional)

### **Environment Variables**
For extra security, you can store credentials as environment variables:
```bash
export INSTAGRAM_CURL="your_curl_command_here"
```

### **Encrypted Storage**
Consider using encrypted storage for sensitive files:
- BitLocker (Windows)
- FileVault (macOS)
- LUKS (Linux)

## 📞 Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:
1. **Don't post it publicly**
2. **Contact the maintainer privately**
3. **Provide detailed reproduction steps**
4. **Wait for a fix before using the tool**
