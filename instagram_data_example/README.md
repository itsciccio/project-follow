## 🔒 Privacy & Security

**IMPORTANT:** The actual `instagram_data/` directory is automatically ignored by Git to protect your privacy. This example directory shows the structure without containing any real user data.

## 📊 Analysis Results

The main output file `users_not_following_back.txt` contains the list of users you follow who don't follow you back - this is the primary goal of the tool.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Run the tool to collect your data
2. Review the generated files
3. Focus on `users_not_following_back.txt` for the main analysis
4. Use JSON/CSV files for detailed data analysis if needed

## ⚠️ Data Handling

- **Never commit** the real `instagram_data/` directory to version control
- **Keep your data private** - it contains real Instagram usernames
- **Respect Instagram's terms of service** when using this data
- **Use responsibly** for personal analysis only
